## Ten strategies to become a better programmer:
- Chunking and Aliasing
- Solve a related but simpler problem
- Build classes independently and let inheritance discover itself
- Repeat tasks manually until patterns emerge, then move to a function
- Consider object orient programming as a graph traversal problem
- Separate ETL from analysis. Separate analysis from presentation.
- Verify type, verify size, view subset of data, and test a subset.
- Humans should never gaze upon unsorted data
- Sets and dict groupings are primary tools for data analysis
